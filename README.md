The Food Nutrition Detection project is an intelligent application designed to analyze images of food and provide detailed nutritional information instantly. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system can identify various food items from images captured via camera or uploaded by the user. Once identified, the application retrieves and presents the nutritional content, such as calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, allowing users to make informed dietary choices.

This project aims to promote healthier eating habits by making nutritional information easily accessible and engaging. It is particularly useful for fitness enthusiasts, individuals with dietary restrictions, or anyone interested in monitoring their daily nutrient intake. The system combines image recognition, data analysis, and an intuitive user interface to create a seamless experience for users.

Key Features:

Real-time food recognition using image input.

Detailed nutritional breakdown for identified foods.

User-friendly interface for easy interaction.

Potential integration with health tracking apps for personalized recommendations.

Supports a wide variety of cuisines and food items.

Technologies Used:

Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras for image processing and machine learning.

Flask or Streamlit for building the user interface.

Nutritional database APIs or CSV datasets for accurate nutrient information.
